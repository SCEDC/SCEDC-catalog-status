#  The following is a listing of the event catalog processing status for year 1999
#  Historically, SCSN analysts have made an effort to review every event in    
#  our catalog. With the growth of the network and catalog, however, complete  
#  review has become more difficult with our limited staff. This is            
#  particularly true of the 2019 Ridgecrest sequence, which remains largely    
#  unreviewed below M2.5.
#  Below we provide information about the review status of the SCSN local event
#  catalog. We hope our catalog users will find this additional context useful.
#  Finalized events have undergone full review and analysis and are unlikely to
#  change. Subnet triggers are collections of phase picks that the real-time   
#  system could not associate into an event. Some of the triggers may be events
#  that are later added to the catalog, although most are just noise. Lastly,  
#  events are sometimes added to the catalog as part of the review process, so 
#  the total number of events can increase. 
# 
#  catalog_date:       The day in UTC time which events occurred. 
#  pct_complete:       Finalized events/(finalized + unreviewed + partial reviewed events) as % 
#                        NaN in this column means there were no events in this day.
#  unreviewed:         Number of real time detected events that have not gone through any review
#  incomplete:         Number of events that have gone through partial review
#  subtrig_cnt:        Number of subnet triggers 
#  max_unreviewed_mag: Highest magnitude of unreviewed event on this day in the catalog
#                        NA in this column means there were no unreviewed events in this day
